# Bop-Lit
An Arduino and fancy crazy snazzy, hugely improved Bop It

Okay so this should be a quick and fun Arduino Project -

# Important planning
* Use a LOT of Sensors
* LEDs?
* Use Voice-Commands-Out
* Make it portable with LiPo batteries
* Use a microcontroller which controls everything
* Decide Module (or Arduino HAT) which can play Audio and load it from an SD card
* Design and 3D-print an enclosure (should be very weird to hold in da hand)


## Possible Sensors (Max. 6, because more would be overwhelming)
* Accelerometer
* Buttons
* Potentiometers / Rotary Encoders
* Toggle Switches
* Humidity Sensor
* Vibration Detector
* Connect two male jumper cables temporary
* Micro-Switch
* Ultra-Sonic-Sensor for distance measuring
* RFID-Card-Reader
* Joystick
* Light-Barrier
* Slide Switch
* Micro-USB-Cable in and out

## Possible Microcontrollers (best with Python and battery-charger and boost)
* [Adafruit Feather M0 Python incl. bat-chg-boost](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-feather-m0-express-designed-for-circuitpython-atsamd21-cortex-m0?variant=40768798794)
* [Adafruit Feather RP2040 Python incl. bat-chg-boost](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884)
* ...or just a boring arduino uno/mega from the sfz....
* ...or a Feather BLE we already bought...

## Extras
* Rumble Motor (DIY with normal Motors?)
  * On while action is running
  * Off while action is not running (a speaker should tell the next task at this time)

# Needed parts to buy
* Microcontroller (still to be decided)
* Sensors (still to be decided)
* Battery charger and booster (if not included in Microcontroller)
* Audio + SD card module
* SD-Card
* Speaker
* LiPo Battery
* Vibration Motors


# First steps
1. Decide which sensors to choose
2. Decide which microcontroller
3. Record saying tasks (and other funny sounds when doing the activity)
4. Test sensors and prepare arduino sketches/python programs to easily read them out
5. Prepare arduino sketch/python program of how the microcontroller should load and play the mp3/wav from the sd card
6. Plan how the thing should look like (and where the microcontroller should sit, etc.)
7. Design the Case
8. Print the Case
9. Solder together all the parts
10. Assemblyyyyyy
