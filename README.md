# Bop-Lit
An Arduino and fancy crazy snazzy, hugely improved Bop It

Okay so this should be a quick and fun Arduino Project -

# Important planning
* Use a LOT of Sensors
* LEDs?
* Use Voice-Commands-Out
* Make it portable with LiPo batteries
* Use a microcontroller which controls everything
* Decide Module (or Arduino HAT) which can play Audio and load it from an SD card
* Design and 3D-print an enclosure (should be very weird to hold in da hand)


## Possible Sensors (Max. 6, because more would be overwhelming)
* Accelerometer
* Buttons
* Potentiometers / Rotary Encoders
* Toggle Switches
* Humidity Sensor
* Vibration Detector
* Connect two male jumper cables temporary
* Micro-Switch
* Ultra-Sonic-Sensor for distance measuring
* RFID-Card-Reader
* Joystick
* Light-Barrier
* Slide Switch
* Micro-USB-Cable in and out

## Possible Microcontrollers (best with Python and battery-charger and boost)
* [Adafruit Feather M0 Python incl. bat-chg-boost](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-feather-m0-express-designed-for-circuitpython-atsamd21-cortex-m0?variant=40768798794)
* [Adafruit Feather RP2040 Python incl. bat-chg-boost] (https://www.adafruit.com/product/4884)
* 

## Extras:
* Rumble Motor (DIY with normal Motors?)
  * On while action is running
  * Off while action is not running (a speaker should tell the next task at this time)

# Needed parts:
* Microcontroller (still to be decided)
* Sensors (still to be decided)
* Battery charger and booster (if not included in Microcontroller)
* Audio + SD card module
* LiPo Battery
* Vibration Motors


# First steps:
1. Decide which sensors to choose
2. Decide which microcontroller
